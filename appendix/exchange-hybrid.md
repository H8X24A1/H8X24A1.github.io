# Exchange Hybrid

A hybrid deployment allows organizations to extend the feature-rich experience and administrative authority they have with their existing on-premises Microsoft Exchange organization to the cloud. A hybrid exchange deployment provides the seamless look and feel of a single Exchange organization between an on-premises Exchange organization and Exchange Online. In addition, a hybrid deployment can serve as an intermediate step to moving to an Exchange Online organization.
