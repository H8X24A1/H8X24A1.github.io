# Languages

Our software is primarily offered in English and German language to cater to the needs of our target audience. These two languages are widely spoken and understood in many parts of the world, making them ideal for our global user base.

However, we understand that our customers come from diverse backgrounds and may prefer to use our software in languages other than English and German. Therefore, we offer the flexibility to provide our software in other languages upon request.

Our team is equipped with the necessary tools and resources to provide software localization services for a wide range of languages. This ensures that our customers can use our software in their preferred language, making it easier for them to use our product and achieve their goals.

We believe in providing a seamless and convenient user experience to our customers, and offering software in multiple languages is one way we can achieve this. So, if any customer requires our software in a different language, they can simply reach out to us, and we will be happy to assist them in meeting their language needs.
