# Use Microsoft Bookings as Room and Desk planner with HXA.io

Microsoft Bookings let employees and all kind of people inside and outside of the organization track, manage and organize appointments in one place. This will leads us to use Microsoft Bookings to order a Room or an Workplace over an Web Page.

### Requirements

To use Microsoft Bookings you need an Microsoft Office 365 license including the Exchange Online Plan. You can order Microsoft 365 licenses via https://www.nettask.de/de/produkte/office-365.html.

## Configuration of Microsoft Bookings for Room and Dask planning

Make sure that Microsoft Bookings is enabled for your organization in the settings of the Microsoft 365 admin center.

If you do not have priviusly created an Room mailbox for a Room or Desk, create a new Room mailbox in Exchange admin center and set the Booking delegates: Automatically accept or decline booking requests.

Open Bookings via the app launcher and add a booking calendar, for your department or office building.

For example. Add the bookable desks as Staff. Search for the right room mailbox and set the room/desk number as initials.

Build a new service for the use of a desk, for instance for the whole day.

You can assign “staff” (resources) to this service (in case of meeting special requirements), or do not assign if every resource should be available for this service. After saving there’s a URL available to share a page for this service.

Now we’re all set to create and publish the booking page to make it available for the people. To keep the booking page for internal use only, enable the access control settings otherwise it will com available in public.

Adjust the settings for the Scheduling policy, Email notifications, Staff and Availability to your needs.

Publish the booking page to make it available via the URL that is shown.

Now we can test/use the published booking page by opening it.
Select a service (desk for whole or half day), day plus start time, and the staff (resource).

Add your details and click the Book button.

This will add the booking to the booking calendar and the calendar of the room mailbox.

The employee will receive a confirmation of the booking with an .ics file to add to his/her calendar, and the option to manage the booking in case of rescheduling or cancelling it.

So Microsoft Bookings can be a great help in planning the occupation of the rooms and desks in your offices!

To make this solution more comfortable we recommend to use our HXA Room Booking Applicatin or HXA Room Booking System on the Rooms or Desk to visualize the booked Status on the Resource (Rooms or Desks) and add some cool features like Check-in/ Check-out or auto-cancel a appointment of no one will come to the Room or Desk in the booked time span to bring the Resource back to the pool for Quick Booking.

Our HXA Room Board Application can help to display the Rooms and Desks they are free or booked for a hole area or space like a flight board on an Air Port.
