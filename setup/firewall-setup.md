### First we need to configure the Firewall Setup to have a stable connection between the HXA.io Application and the HXA.io API.

 The HXA.io Devices need an unblocked communication betweeen the Local Network and the HXA.io API IP Address Ranges which are mentioned below:

168.63.108.0/24

65.52.150.0/24

65.52.151.0/24

65.52.142.0/24

51.144.7.0/24

Therefore please add the IP ranges to your firewall to have them passthrough any securtiy block you may encounter within you netwrok.
