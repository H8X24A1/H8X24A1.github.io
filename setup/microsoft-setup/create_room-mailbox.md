- Email address: A room mailbox has an email address so it can receive booking requests. The email address consists of an alias on the left side of the @ symbol, which must be unique in the forest, and your domain name on the right. The email address is required.
- Location, Phone, Capacity: You can use these fields to enter details about the room. However, as explained earlier, you can include some or all of this information in the room name so users can see it.

Once you've created your room mailbox, you can edit your room mailbox to update info about booking options, MailTips and mailbox delegation. Check out the Use the Classic Exchange admin center section below to change room mailbox properties.
